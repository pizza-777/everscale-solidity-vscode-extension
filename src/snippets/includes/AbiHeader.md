Force message forming utility to fill an appropriate field(s) in the header of the exteranl inbound message to be sent to this contract:

* **pubkey** - public key by which the message can be signed;
* **time** - local time at what message was created;
* **notime** - disables `time` abi header, which is enabled by default. Abi header `time` â€“ `uint64` local time when message was created, used for replay protection
* **expire** - time at which message should be meant as expired.

**pubkey** field is optional. Let's consider some cases:

* If the message contains signature and optional field pubkey is set then the field pubkey is used to check signature.
* If the message contains signature and optional field pubkey is empty then the tvm.pubkey() is used to check signature. See also: msg.pubkey() and tvm.pubkey(). time and expire fields can be used for replay protection and if set they should be read in afterSignatureCheck in case of not default replay protection.
